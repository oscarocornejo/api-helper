# api-helper
This module attempts to make it easy for the user to create api endpoints.

Modules used:
* Express

Instructions:
* Set the port number you want the endpoints to be exposed on
* Save all of your endpoints in `src/api`
* Endpoints take the name of the file
  * ie: `User.js` = `https://mywebsite.com/api/user`
* Boot up server by running `app.js` with `node app.js`

Api Files:
> A skeleton was provided in order to help
* File should export **get** and **post** callback functions.

Happy Coding!
